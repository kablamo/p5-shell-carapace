Revision history for Shell-Carapace

{{$NEXT}}

0.11 2015-03-24T23:45:49Z
    - Die noisely

0.10 2015-02-24T22:02:17Z
    - Made print_cmd attribute read/write.

0.09 2015-02-18T20:30:00Z
    - Tee output to the log file.  This time the exit code is preserved.

0.08 2015-02-18T15:42:16Z
    - Revert most of 0.07.  Piping to tee means we can't know what the exit
      code of the command is.  Added a test so this case isn't missed in the
      future.

0.07 2015-02-18T00:56:10Z
    - Pipe command to tee by default so logfile is written to in realtime.

0.06 2015-02-12T15:28:05Z
    - Die earlier if logfile has bad permissions

0.05 2015-02-12T00:09:13Z
    - Don't use 'coerce => 1' so Shell::Carapace is compatible with 
      Moo <1.006000

0.04 2015-02-09T18:54:46Z
    - Allow logfile attr to be undef

0.03 2015-02-09T14:25:24Z
    - Made logging to a file optional

0.02 2015-02-09T11:06:44Z
    - Minor updates to pod

0.01 2015-02-08T23:37:48Z
